  ` Hey! My name is Angela and I'm a third-year Software Engineering
    student at McMaster University. I discovered my passion in tech after coding
    a virtual robot arm to pick up some virtual boxes in my first-year
    engineering design course, and ever since then fell in love with the logic,
    problem-solving, and creativity that comes with programming.`,
  `Most of my previous experiences have been in fullstack web and app
    development, although I'm more interested in the backend side of
    things. I also enjoy learning about algorithms that blow my mind and
    I'm a pretty big fan of design patterns and OOP.`,
  `Outside of work, I enjoy expressing myself through digital art, reaching my
    fitness goals through rock climbing and swimming, and exploring different
    worlds through gaming - some of my favourites are Hollow Knight and Ori for
    their amazing storytelling, art/design and soundtracks :)`,
