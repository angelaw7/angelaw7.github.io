  ` Hey! My name is Angela and I'm an incoming 4th year Software Engineering
    student at McMaster University. I discovered my passion in tech after coding
    a virtual robot arm to pick up some virtual boxes in my first-year
    engineering design course, and ever since then fell in love with the logic,
    problem-solving, and creativity that comes with programming.`,
  `Most of my previous experiences have been in fullstack web and app
    development, and I'm particularly interested on backend.
    I enjoy learning about algorithms that blow my mind, and
    I'm a pretty big fan of object-oriented programming, design patterns and
    software/system architecture.`,
  `Outside of work, I enjoy digital art, rock climbing, weightlifting, and
    exploring different worlds and stories through gaming!`,
