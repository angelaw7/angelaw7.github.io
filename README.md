Version 2 of my personal website - I wanted to change up the theme a little bit to make it more minimalistic and somewhat game-like. It was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Take a look here!: https://angelaw7.vercel.app/

## Todo List
- [x] Animations
- [ ] Make profile card flippable
- [ ] More fox :D
